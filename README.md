# Rock! Paper! Scissors!
**Hello Everyone!**
I am very happy to share my new Web Application game which is very familiar to most of us. It's ROCK PAPER SCISSORS !! Play this wonderful game, Enjoy your childhood memories and have fun :)

# How to Play:

**This game is based on priority**
* 🥌 > ✂️
* 📰 > 🥌
* ✂️ > 📰
* So when your choice has higher priority you win! Else...
* Try Again 😜
So the player who reaches 5 points first will win the game!

Most of the games are based upon randomness (i.e, Dice games, Book Cricket, etc...). So I have used a random function to predict the choices of the computer! I have used simple #html5, #css3, and #javascript to build this web application. This game is also responsive on Mobile devices!
